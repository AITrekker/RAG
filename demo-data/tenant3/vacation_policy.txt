InnovateFast Inc. - Time Off Philosophy

At InnovateFast, we hire professionals and trust you to manage your own time. We don't track vacation days because we believe in focusing on results, not on hours clocked.

**Our Approach: Unlimited PTO**

We offer unlimited paid time off. This isn't a trick; it's a reflection of our trust in you. We want you to take the time you need to feel your best, whether it's for a family vacation, a personal project, or just a day to recharge your batteries.

**How It Works:**

1.  **Coordinate with Your Team:** Give your manager and your team a heads-up before you take time off. Make sure your responsibilities are covered.
2.  **No Formal Tracking:** There are no forms to fill out or beans to count. Just make sure your work is getting done and you're communicating with your team.
3.  **Be Reasonable:** We're all adults here. "Unlimited" doesn't mean you can disappear for three months without notice. Be respectful of your colleagues and your commitments.

The goal is to create a culture of freedom and responsibility. Take the time you need, deliver amazing work, and help us build something great.
