Regional Solutions - Employee Vacation Policy

We believe in a healthy work-life balance and encourage our employees to take time off to rest and recharge.

**Paid Time Off (PTO)**
-   All full-time employees receive 160 hours (20 days) of PTO per year.
-   PTO is for you to use for vacations, personal time, or sick leave.
-   Your PTO accrues throughout the year and will be reflected on your pay stub.

**Requesting Time Off**
-   Please provide at least two (2) weeks' notice for any planned vacations.
-   You can request time off by sending an email or calendar invite to your direct manager.
-   We'll do our best to accommodate all requests, but they are subject to team availability and project deadlines.

**Using Your Time**
-   We encourage you to use all of your PTO each year.
-   You can roll over up to 40 hours of unused PTO to the next year.
-   There is no payout for unused PTO if you leave the company.

We trust you to manage your time responsibly. If you have any questions, please speak with your manager.
